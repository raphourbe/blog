## Context

See [Part 1](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part1) for Context details.

This series is structured as follows:

1. The design of the app, [part 1](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part1)
2. The database, [part 2](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part2)
3. Directus flow [this post]
4. Stripe webhooks, [part 4](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part4)

Here we will focus on the Flows implementation.

As mentioned in our [Part 1](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part1),
we want the following processes for user registration:

> 3. My Customers must be able to register on the platform without my intervention. But I want them to
>    activate their account using a link in a mail.
> 4. I do not want to create a Stripe Customer if the user account on my platform is not activated using the
>    link in the mail.

I used two Flows here to handle these requirements. The first one sends
an email with an activation link. The second one creates a new Stripe Customer
when the activation link is clicked.

## Email Flow after an account creation

This Flow is similar to the Newsletter subscription flow described
[here](https://rphl.dev/blog/creating-newsletter-subscription-form-directus).

### Creating a token for the user (not a Flow)

To send an email of activation I needed to attribute a token to my user.

When a user validate the user form, a token is assigned to them, and registered in
the `directus_users` table in the `token` field.

To create this token, I use Directus API to be sure my token
meets Directus requirements:

```js
async function generate_random_token(directus_url) {
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }
  return await fetch(directus_url + 'utils/random/string', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers,
  })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log('random token error:', error)
      return 'error'
    })
}
```

I call this function once the user clicks on the Subscribe button at the end
of the subscription form, before sending the data to directus. This step could actually be
refactored to become a new Flow by the way...

### Sending the activation email

![Send activation email Flow](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-3/send_activation_email_whole_flow.webp)

First, what triggers my Flow is the `items.create` scope for the `customer_details` table.
When a user submits the form, a Directus user with the `Customer` Role is created, and also
a row in the `customer_details` table.

Then, I check if it is indeed a `Customer` with a **Condition** operation, to be sure it is not an `Admin` or another role:

![Customer condition](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-3/send_activation_email_customer_condition.webp)

Then I use the **Send email** operation once.

![Send email](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-3/send_activation_email_send_email.webp)

<div className="mb-4 rounded-lg bg-orange-100 px-4 pt-4 pb-2 text-orange-700 dark:bg-orange-200 dark:text-orange-800">
  <p className="m-0 pb-0 text-lg font-medium">Information</p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    Please note that it is important to press enter once you have typed the email variable in the
    `To` field and have the email variable appearing below the field. Otherwise, it is like you did
    not enter anything (see picture above for the result you should have).
  </p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    You can use the `{}` next to the `To` field to toggle the raw editor and add
    directly the mail required as such:
  </p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    ```
    ["{{$trigger.payload.user_id.email}}"]
    ```
    </p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    As mentioned in the [Part 2](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part2)
    of this series, at the <span className="text-orange-700 dark:text-orange-800 font-bold">The Many to One relationship,
    and the naming pitfall</span> paragraph,
    the naming convention for user is not properly done here.
    It should be `user` and not `user_id`.
  </p>
</div>

Then what is important is to have the endpoint of your website where the logic
to activate the account is. Somtehing like: `https://your-saas.com/user/validate?tok={{$trigger.payload.user_id.token}}&cd={{$trigger.key}}`

Since I have an `account_activated` field in my `customer_details`,
I add directly the row `id` in the link using `cd={{$trigger.key}}`. It allows me to directly update the proper row.

I am sure there is a better way,
and a more secure way to do it. Like just giving the token, and add some logic to retrieve the row in the table using
only the user's token (it's on my Todo list). But, as you will see, I discard the token
right after that and my user will not have any token anymore to call the API. So to some extent
it is ok for the moment.

My next step in this Flow is to send myself an email, so I have the information
when a new `Customer` activated her account.

## Creating a Stripe Customer with a Flow

![Create Stripe Customer Flow](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-3/create-stripe-customer-flow.webp)

The main idea behind the Flow is to check when an Update happens to a row of `customer_details`
table if it is the `activated_account` boolean that is becoming `true`.

If the answer is positive, then I verify that my `Customer` does not have a `Stripe Customer ID`. If she does not,
then I read some customer's information and send them to Stripe with `stripe.customers.create`, and retrieve the
`Stripe Customer ID` and save it into the database.

I think I do not need to go over every operations of the whole Flow process (if you think I need, please ask in the comments).

The important steps to detail here are the **Run Script** operation, and the update one right after I believe. Here is my code for the **Run Script**:

```js
module.exports = async function (data) {
  const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_live_YOUR_KEY')

  const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
    email: data.read_user.email,
    name: data.read_user_id.enterprise,
    address: {
      city: data.read_user_id.address_city,
      country: data.read_user_id.address_country,
      line1: data.read_user_id.address_line,
      postal_code: data.read_user_id.address_postal_code,
    },
    preferred_locales: ['fr-FR'],
    metadata: {
      directusId: data.read_user_id.user_id,
    },
  })
  return customer
}
```

Please be aware that to use `stripe-js` here, you need to activate it, as described in my post:
[Integrate Stripe to Directus' flows.](https://rphl.dev/blog/integrate-stripe-to-directus-flow)

For the **Update** operation, what is important to keep in mind is these Flow rules:

- You can use raw expression when you toggle the `{}` next to the fields titles.
  In the next image, I have toggled it so you can see how it is different from the "normal" state.
- You can use the name of the previous operations to retrieve their result. In my example, my Run Script which
  create the Stripe Customer in Stripe and get back the `Stripe Customer ID` is called:
  `post_stripe_create_customer`. I use this information in the _Paylod_ field of the **Update** operation directly.

![Create Stripe Customer Flow](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-3/create-stripe-customer-flow-save-operation.webp)

As you might have noticed, at the end of the Flow is a **_Remove Directus Token_** operation, that removes the
token of the user. So once the account is activated, the `Customer` will never be able to call the API with
her token.

For more information on Flow, please refer to the
[Directus' official documentation](https://docs.directus.io/configuration/flows.html).
At the moment the Cookbook is not entirely finished, but the Directus team is working on it.
