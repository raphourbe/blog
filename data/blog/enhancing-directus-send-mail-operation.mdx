## Context

While reading a few discussions on the github of Directus, I found [this question](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/16726).
The main problem with the **Send Mail** operation of Directus Flow is that it lacks a few functionalities, like: Cc, Bcc or Reply to.

I went to build a new Send Mail operation with these elements to understand how to build Operations for Flow.

I used `directus v9.21.2` to build it.

## Building the extension folder

You need to create an extension to build your own operation. 
It is well explained how to [start a new extension](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/creating-extensions.html) in the documentation,
and have a template. If you want to copy past my code, please select `Javascript` instead of `Typescript` for the following code. 
Or adapt it to your Typescript needs.
