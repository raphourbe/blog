## Context

While reading a few discussions on the github of Directus, I found [this question](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/16726).
The main problem with the **Send Mail** operation of Directus Flow is that it lacks a few functionalities, like: Cc, Bcc or Reply to.

I went to build a new Send Mail operation with these elements to understand how to build Operations for Flow.

I used `directus v9.21.2` to build it.

The new functionalities will be:

- Cc
- Bcc
- Reply to in the header of the mail
- Selecting a template

<br />

## Building the extension folder

You need to create an extension to build your own operation. 
It is well explained how to [start a new extension](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/creating-extensions.html) in the documentation,
and have a template. If you want to copy past my code, please select `Javascript` instead of `Typescript` for the following code. 
Or adapt it to your Typescript needs.

You just need to type: `npm init directus-extension` and follow the instructions (selecting operation, then javascript).

## Modifying app.js

The `app.js` file is used to design the panel in Directus Flow that you will parametrize while building your flow. It basically consists in creating a few fields in the Send Mail form.

```jsx:app.js
export default {
  id: "custom-mail-operation",
  name: "Custom Mail Operation",
  icon: "mail",
  description: "Enhanced the Send Mail Operation",
  overview: ({ body, to, cc, replyTo, bcc, type, subject, template }) => [
    {
      label: "Subject",
      text: subject,
    },
    {
      label: "To",
      text: Array.isArray(to) ? to.join(", ") : to,
    },
    {
      label: "Cc",
      text: Array.isArray(cc) ? cc.join(", ") : cc,
    },
    {
      label: "Bcc",
      text: Array.isArray(bcc) ? bcc.join(", ") : bcc,
    },
    {
      label: "Reply to",
      text: replyTo,
    },
    {
      label: "Type",
      text: type || "markdown",
    },
    {
      label: "Body",
      text: body,
    },
    {
      label: "Template",
      text: template,
    },
  ],
  options: (panel) => {
    return [
      {
        field: "to",
        name: "To",
        type: "csv",
        meta: {
          width: "full",
          interface: "tags",
          options: {
            iconRight: "alternate_email",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        field: "cc",
        name: "Cc",
        type: "csv",
        meta: {
          width: "full",
          interface: "tags",
          options: {
            iconRight: "alternate_email",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        field: "bcc",
        name: "Bcc",
        type: "csv",
        meta: {
          width: "full",
          interface: "tags",
          options: {
            iconRight: "alternate_email",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        field: "replyTo",
        name: "Reply To",
        type: "string",
        meta: {
          width: "full",
          interface: "input",
          options: {
            iconRight: "alternate_email",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        field: "subject",
        name: "Subject",
        type: "string",
        meta: {
          width: "full",
          interface: "input",
          options: {
            iconRight: "title",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        field: "template",
        name: "Template",
        type: "string",
        meta: {
          width: "full",
          interface: "input",
          options: {
            iconRight: "title",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        field: "type",
        name: "Type",
        type: "string",
        schema: {
          default_value: "markdown",
        },
        meta: {
          interface: "select-dropdown",
          width: "half",
          options: {
            choices: [
              {
                text: "markdown",
                value: "markdown",
              },
              {
                text: "wysiwyg",
                value: "wysiwyg",
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
      {
        field: "body",
        name: "Body",
        type: "text",
        meta: {
          width: "full",
          interface:
            panel.type === "wysiwyg"
              ? "input-rich-text-html"
              : "input-rich-text-md",
        },
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

## Modifying the api.js

The `api.js` file is the logic part: what is happening once your
**Send Email** operation form is read by Directus.

Directus uses [NodeMailer](https://nodemailer.com/message/) under the
hood to send mails. So the aim here is to give the proper information to NodeMailer.

I copy/paste the function of Directus that uses sanitizeHTML to transform
markdown into html, because I did not know how to access it directly otherwise.

The function check if the body of the message is markdown or comes from
wysiwyg and transform the body.

Then it checks if we added a `Template` name.
If nothing is entered in the _template_ field of the operation in the Flow dashboard,
a `null` value is passed to this function and we uses the default function of NodeMailer
which result in a simple mail with no design.

If you do want to use a template, type the name of your template file 
(if you have `super-template.liquid` for example as a template file, type `super-tempate` in the text area).
Be aware that the html will be put into the `{{html}}` of your template. So you need one. If you want a how-to for
creating mail template, please tell me in the comments.

```jsx:api.js
import { marked } from "marked";
import sanitizeHTML from "sanitize-html";

/**
 * Render and sanitize a markdown string
 */
export function md(str) {
  return sanitizeHTML(marked(str));
}

export default {
  id: "custom-mail-operation",
  handler: async (
    { body, to, cc, replyTo, bcc, type, subject, template },
    { accountability, database, getSchema, services }
  ) => {
    const { MailService } = services;
    const mailService = new MailService({
      schema: await getSchema({ database }),
      accountability,
      knex: database,
    });

    // If you don't want to specify a template use this.
    if (template == "" || template == null)
      await mailService.send({
        html: type === "wysiwyg" ? body : md(body),
        to: to,
        cc: cc,
        bcc: bcc,
        replyTo: replyTo,
        subject: subject,
      });
    // If you want a template => you need to have {{ html }}
    // in your template
    else
      await mailService.send({
        to: to,
        cc: cc,
        bcc: bcc,
        replyTo: replyTo,
        subject: subject,
        template: {
          name: template !== null || template !== undefined ? template : "base",
          data: { html: type === "wysiwyg" ? body : md(body) },
        },
      });
  },
};
```

## Build the Operation and add it to Directus

Once our code is done, we need to run `npm run build` in the folder directus-extension created for us.
Then we retrieve the content of the `/dist` folder into your directus folder: `/extension/operations/custom-enhanced-mail`.

You should then have your new panel inside Flow available.
