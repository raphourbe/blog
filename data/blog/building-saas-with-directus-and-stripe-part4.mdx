## Context

See [Part 1](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part1) for Context details.

This series is structured as follows:

1. The design of the app, [part 1](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part1)
2. The database, [part 2](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part2)
3. Directus flow, [part 3](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part3)
4. Stripe webhooks [this post]

Here we will focus on the Stripe Webhooks implementation.

As mentioned in our [Part 1](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part1), we want the following processes for user registration:

> 5. I do not want to handle the payment informations of my clients, so I let Stripe handle this part. It will have some consequences on the type of billing available.
> 6. I want the trial period to start only after the Customer added her payment information in Stripe.
> 7. I do not need to start billing at a particular date in a month.
> 8. The app must communicate with Stripe to know when a Customer can or cannot access the app regarding her payment status. So I will tackle in this series the webhooks part in-depth.

I used two Flows here to handle these requirements. The first one sends an email with an activation link. The second one creates a new Stripe Customer when the activation link is clicked.

## Stripe implementation in the frontend

### Quick description

I do not have a part where I explain precisely how I integrate Stripe in my frontend. For this part, I believe there is already plainty of resources, especially on the Stripe documentation for the Next.js part, which is my front.

I decided to go with the Stripe Checkout implementation and followed a mix of this [how-to](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart?client=next) for the Checkout and [this one](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/quickstart?client=react) to customize the parameters for the billing process.

This implementation, if done properly secures these three requirements:

> 5. I do not want to handle the payment informations of my clients, so I let Stripe handle this part. It will have some consequences on the type of billing available.

Using Stripe Checkout and never ask Stripe about the payment details tackles this.

> 6. I want the trial period to start only after the Customer added her payment information in Stripe.

If you want this feature, it is quite simple: never create yourself the subscription for your customer. Just send them to Stripe Checkout when they select the product they want to buy. Stripe will ask for all the details before giving the trial period.

> 7. I do not need to start billing at a particular date in a month.

This is the current default (at least at the time I publish this post): you cannot add a start date for the billing period when you use Stripe Checkout.

However, it appears you can [modify a current subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle) to achieve this goal. I try to think about it, and did not come up with something appealing enough to my taste, and did not find anything about that on our vast world wild web...

### Do not forget to pass the Stripe Customer ID

What is important to remember if you followed this guide, is to pass to Stripe Checkout the `Stripe Customer ID` of the customer to the `checkout_session`, since your customer already have one. If you do not, then Stripe will create a new `Customer ID` at payment and will send it back to you. But for your specific customer, it will be as if she did not pay.

The parameters for the checkout session look like this:

```js:checkout.js
// the Stripe Customer ID that already exists is given by
// req.body.customerId
var params = {
    mode: "subscription",
    payment_method_types: payment_method_types,
    metadata: { price_id: priceId },
    line_items: [line_item],
    success_url: `${req.headers.origin}/payment/result?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${req.headers.origin}/payment/cancel-subscription-process`,
    client_reference_id: req.body.customerId,
    currency: "EUR",
    customer: req.body.customerId,
    billing_address_collection: "required",
    locale: "fr",
    customer_update: {
        name: "auto",
        address: "auto",
    },
    tax_id_collection: {
        enabled: true,
    },
};
if (daysOfTrial)
    params["subscription_data"] = {
        trial_period_days: daysOfTrial,
    };
const checkoutSession = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create(params);
```

## Layout of the Directus extensions

You can find how to create an extension on the
[Directus documentation](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/creating-extensions.html).

However, one thing it does not tell you, is what happens when you use their `npm init directus-extension`. Well it creates a specific folder with some pre-built files. One thing is, since it will have a `/src` and a `/dist` folders, you do not want to put them inside your `/directus/extensions/endpoints/your-endpoint` folder.

The way I do it is I create the extension with the `npm init directus-extension` at the root of my `/directus` folder. Then, when I build my extension, I place the result of the `/dist` folder where they need to. It might not be the best option, but at least on my computer everything for directus is at the same place.

At the end of this part 4, my directus folder looks like:

```
.
├── node_modules
├── uploads
├── extensions                          # All your extensions
|   ├── endpoints                       # Listener for the Stripe webhooks
|   |   └── stripe-webhook
|   |       └── index.js
|   └── hooks                           # Your custom hook using a middleware to retrieve the raw request body
|       └── stripe-webhook-middleware
|           └── index.js
├── stripe-webhook                      # Listener for the Stripe webhooks
|   ├── dist
|   └── src
├── stripe-webhook-middleware           # Middleware to modify the Stripe response
|   ├── dist
|   └── src
└── .env
```

If you want to replicate this, you need to create two extensions:

- the _stripe-webhook-middleware_ which is a **Hook** extension.
  This extension is needed to transform what Stripe sends you into a raw format.
- the _stripe-webhook_ which is an **Endpoint** extension.
  This is where I handle what Stripe sends me.

## Building the stripe-webhook-middleware hook

I did a post on this particular topic: [read it](https://rphl.dev/blog/create-stripe-webhook-listener-directus). You absolutly need this extension otherwise you will not be able to use `stripe-js`.

The role of this Hook extension is to ensure that the request.body is the raw request body.

## Building a Stripe Webhooks endpoint

> 8. The app must communicate with Stripe to know when a Customer can or cannot access the app regarding her payment status. So I will tackle in this series the webhooks part in-depth.

### Creating the stripe-webhook endpoint development folder

I used `npm init directus-extension` and installed `stripe-js` for the endpoint (if you follow this guide, I use JavaScript and not TypeScript. You will be asked to pick one when you use the `npm init directus-extension`).

Then I created 2 files:

- `index.js`, where I configure Stripe and prepare all the Directus Services I will need, and dispatch the event to the proper handling function
- `handler.js`, where I create a Handler which will act accordingly to the event.

You will find the [complete files on the github repo](https://github.com/raphourbe/blog/tree/main/public/static/code/stripe-webhook-endpoint) of this blog if you want to copy/paste them.

<div className="mb-4 rounded-lg bg-orange-100 px-4 pt-4 pb-2 text-orange-700 dark:bg-orange-200 dark:text-orange-800">
  <p className="m-0 pb-0 text-lg font-medium">Information</p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    Please note that you can, when building Directus extensions use `process.env.YOURVALUE` which
    refers to variables inside the `.env` file of Directus (not of the extension). Useful to put
    some Stripe API key for example.
  </p>
</div>

### Stripe's configuration

For this part, the Stripe documentation is properly done. If you read the full post to [create the stripe-webhook-middleware](https://rphl.dev/blog/create-stripe-webhook-listener-directus), you already have it.

So at the beginning of my `index.js` file, I have my configuration, which is mostly a verification that it is Stripe that is sending me some data.

As mentioned above, you can use `process.env.SOMETHING` to replace in the code below the _'sk_test_SOMETHINGSECRET'_ if you do not want to hardcode it. It might be helpful to keep your development/production Stripe API Key somewhere else.

```js:index.js
export default (router, { services, exceptions, database, schema, logger }) => {
  const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_SOMETHINGSECRET')
  const endpointSecret = 'whsec_SOMETHINGSECRET'

  router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    // MAIN DIFFERENCE WITH STRIPE EXAMPLE
    let event = req.rawBody

    // Only verify the event if you have an endpoint secret defined.
    // Otherwise use the basic event deserialized with JSON.parse
    if (endpointSecret) {
      // Get the signature sent by Stripe
      const signature = req.headers['stripe-signature']
      try {
        event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
          req.rawBody, // MAIN DIFFERENCE WITH STRIPE EXAMPLE
          signature,
          endpointSecret
        )
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(`⚠️  Webhook signature verification failed.`, err.message)
        return res.sendStatus(400)
      }
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Preparing Directus' services

I need two Directus services for this part:

- ItemServices, to retrieve data from the database. I create 3 services linked to the tables _"customer_details"_, _"customer_subscriptions"_, and _"subscription_items"_. I use them in the Handler.
- MailServices, to send to the customers emails regarding their subscriptions. It is based on NodeMailer, and you can implement mail templates with it. This is the solution I use.

So in `index.js`, I call the Directus services and instantiate a few one as follow:

```js:index.js
export default (router, { services, exceptions, database, schema, logger }) => {
  router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    // The Stripe configuration here
    // ...

    const { ItemsService, MailService } = services;
    const { ServiceUnavailableException } = exceptions;

    const mailer = new MailService({ schema, knex: database });

    const customerDetailsService = new ItemsService("customer_details", {
      schema: req.schema,
    });
    const customerSubscriptionService = new ItemsService(
      "customer_subscriptions",
      {
        schema: req.schema,
        accountability: {
          role: "admin",
          admin: true,
        },
      }
    );
    const subscriptionItemService = new ItemsService("subscription_items", {
      schema: req.schema,
      accountability: {
        role: "admin",
        admin: true,
      },
    });

    // ...
  }
}
```

### The events to listen to, and why

Since we are in a SaaS situation, we deal with subscriptions. If there is only one critic I have regarding the Stripe documentation, is that it does not give you the order of the webhooks that are sent. Or maybe I missed it. I might be guilty of that.

I did not find this information whereas I think it is quite useful to know to build the webhooks handler, so here it is. (I used the timeclock function of Stripe to generate tests here. So if you see things related to it, you can omit them).

#### When you receive your first subscription

![List of the first subscription events](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-4/stripe-first-sub-order.webp)

What is important for the subscription, is to get the `customer.subscription.created` event. With this event you know a Customer subscribed to a trial period.

For me personnaly, I do not care about the invoices, and the Customer update.

<div className="mb-4 rounded-lg bg-orange-100 px-4 pt-4 pb-2 text-orange-700 dark:bg-orange-200 dark:text-orange-800">
  <p className="m-0 pb-0 text-lg font-medium">Information</p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    Please be aware that regarding the differences between what your Customer entered in the Stripe
    Checkout form, and the informations you gave Stripe when creating the Stripe Customer, the
    `customer.update` event might be useful for you.
  </p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    Stripe updates its information about Customer regarding what the Customer entered in the
    Checkout form, and erases what you gave. Checking the event can give you this information.
  </p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    Also, if you did not create a Stripe Customer manually before this, or you do not provide the
    `Stripe Customer ID` to the checkout session, a new `Stripe Customer ID` will be created.
  </p>
</div>

#### When your customer reaches the end of her trial period

![List of the end of the trial period events](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-4/stripe-trial-will-end.webp)

You can probably dismiss this one, since Stripe is supposed to send a mail to the Customers directly to remind them their trial periods are about to end.

However, I decided to listen to `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`, and to send my Customer my own email (which goes in addition to the Stripe's one). Plus, I also send myself an email, to be sure to check what is going to happen in the next three days. Or to call my Customer and ask questions about the product... please stay 🙏

#### When your customer pays

![List of the payment events](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-4/stripe-subscription-payment.webp)

At this point, my Customer did stay. I want to retrieve the content of `invoice.paid` which means exactly what it means. With it, I know that I can give access to my app. So I can update the `stripe_subscription_status` in my database that I read to know if the Customer can access the app.

I also want to retrieve the information in `customer.subscription.updated` since it is the only place I can retrieve the end date of the current subscription, and the type of subscription (month or annual payments). It is important if you have several plans to check it, because this is where you will find the information.

#### When your customer ends her subscription

![List of the cancelation events](/static/images/directus-stripe-part-4/stripe-subscription-deleted.webp)

I want to listen to `customer.subscription.deleted` to send a goodbye email, and also check if I end the access to the Customer right now (cases when your customer did not pay for the month, and 3 days after the invoice is sent, canceled the subscription), or at the end of a period (the Customer paid for the month and canceled during the month. She needs to have access until the end of the month).

#### When there is a problem

The last event I listen to is `invoice.payment_action_required`, which means that there is a problem with a Customer. When this happens, I want to send to the customer and to me a mail. This way, I am informed of a problem and I can keep track of it.

I do not have a screenshot for this one, but you will also get with this event a `customer.subscription.updated` where you will have a new `status` for the subscription. If it is because the Customer did not pay, then she will be blocked.

### The handler

My handler is an Object that contains how to handle the various events Stripe sends. Its source code is [available here](https://github.com/raphourbe/blog/tree/main/public/static/code/stripe-webhook-endpoint).

I initialize the `Handler` in the `index.js` file, and do a `switch case` to select the event and the function.

```js:index.js

```

#### New subscription

A new subscription can happen in two cases: (1) the Customer is new, so we do not have any row for her in the _customer_subscriptions_ table, or (2) she had a subscription, canceled it, then renew it. In this second case, we already have a row for her in database, so we need to update it.

This is what you will find in the `handleSubscriptionCreated` function, which is `async` by the way.

As you will notice in the function, I make use of [email templates](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/email-templates.html). If you need information on how to handle them, please let me know in the comments.

```js:handler.js
async handleSubscriptionCreated(data) {
  // A subscription is created. Since, we are using trial periods,
  // we start with this webhook to create a subscription.
  console.log('Enter: handleSubscriptionCreated')
  try {
    const customerDetails = await this.getCustomerDetails(data.customer)
    const customerSubscription = await this.getCustomerSubscription(customerDetails.id)
    const subscriptionItem = await this.getSubscriptionItemFromPriceId(data.plan.id)

    const trialEnd = this.getDateToString(new Date(data.trial_end * 1000))

    try {
      if (customerSubscription.length == 0) {
        console.log(`No data in DB for ${customerDetails.id}.`)
        // The subscription status will be set to the default
        // value in DB (here "trialing").
        this.customerSubscriptionService.createOne({
          customer_details: customerDetails.id,
          subscription_items: subscriptionItem.id,
          trial_ends_at: trialEnd,
        })
      } else {
        console.log(`A row already exists for customer_subscriptions ${customerDetails.id}.`)
        console.log(`Update stripe_subscription_status to ${data.status}`)
        var item = {
          stripe_subscription_status: data.status,
        }
        // Compare with our DB record
        // Do nothing or get the plan relative to the new price_id.
        if (customerSubscription[0].subscription_items.id !== subscriptionItem.id) {
          // Not the correct plan !
          item.subscription_items = subscriptionItem.id
        }

        if (data.status === 'trialing') {
          console.log(`End trial period set to ${trialEnd}.`)
          item.trial_ends_at = trialEnd
          item.ends_at = null
        }

        this.customerSubscriptionService.updateOne(customerSubscription[0].id, item)
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
      console.log('Exit with error for creation: handleCheckoutSessionCompleted')
      return false
    }

    // Send the email if it's the first time the customer subscribe.
    if (customerSubscription.length == 0) {
      try {
        console.log('Send mail to ', customerDetails.user_id.email)
        await this.mailService.send({
          to: customerDetails.user_id.email,
          bcc: 'mymail@mail.com',
          subject: 'Bienvenue !',
          template: {
            name: 'subscription-started',
            data: {
              firstName: customerDetails.user_id.first_name,
              trialEnd: trialEnd,
              daysOfTrial: subscriptionItem.days_of_trial,
            },
          },
        })

        console.log('Send mail to admin')
        await this.mailService.send({
          to: 'admin@website.com',
          subject: 'New subscription created',
          template: {
            name: 'admin-new-subscription',
            data: {
              eventName: 'customer.subscription.created',
              customerId: customerDetails.user_id.id,
              customerEmail: customerDetails.user_id.email,
              trialEnd: trialEnd,
              daysOfTrial: subscriptionItem.days_of_trial,
              action: 'Create new customer_subscriptions row in table.',
            },
          },
        })
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
        console.log('Exit with error for mail: handleSubscriptionCreated')
        return false
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
    console.log('Exit with error when getting items in DB: handleSubscriptionCreated')
    return false
  }
}
```
