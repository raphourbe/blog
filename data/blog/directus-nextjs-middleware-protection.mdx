## The main problem

I have parts of my SaaS app that need to be undisclosed for users who are not suscribded yet.
Hence, I have decided to use Next.js middleware to avoid doing multiple authorization checks everywhere in my app.

However, the authentication process from Directus
[only returns three parameters](https://docs.directus.io/reference/authentication.html#response-attributes)
(`access_token`, `expires` and `refresh_token`), and You cannot modify that.
So I needed to implement some fetching to check if the user did pay.

This is not a tough problem to solve, however, here is how you could implement the middleware in Next.js
based on my experience with the matter.

<div className="px-4 pt-4 pb-2 mb-4 text-orange-700 bg-orange-100 rounded-lg dark:bg-orange-200 dark:text-orange-800">
  <p className="m-0 pb-0 text-lg font-medium">Information</p>
  <p className="m-0 pt-0 text-lg">
    I do understand that the middleware needs to be fast. However, the middleware is running only
    one fetch function for the logged part of the app. Plus, this fetch would happen in the app
    anyway.

## Code example

### Simple implementation

Let's say I have a role in Directus that is "Customer". I have a `customer_details` table
with a `subscribed` boolean column, that is linked to my `directus_users` table with a
one to one relationship (see [documentation](https://docs.directus.io/configuration/data-model/relationships.html#one-to-one-o2o)
for the implementation).

The implementation could be something like this to adapt to your convenience.

```jsx:middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { gql } from 'graphql-request'

export default withAuth(async function middleware(req) {
  const isSubscribed = async (token) => {
    const headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    }
    const userDetails = await fetch('https://yourDirectusApi/graphql', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        gql`
          query {
            customer_details(
                filter: { user: { id: { _eq: "$CURRENT_USER" } } }
            ) {
                subscribed
              }
            }
          }
        `,
      }),
    })

    if (userDetails.data.subscribed) return true
    return false
  }

  // you have to adapt this part to how you store your user token
  // I show a Nextauth implementation under this example.
  const token = req.headers.get('Authorization')
  const url = req.nextUrl

  if (await isSubscribed(token)) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }

  // the user is not subscribed properly, we redirect her to the user panel
  // where she can subscribe.
  url.pathname = '/user/details'

  return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL(url, req.url))
})

// We only run the middleware for the dashboard part of the app for now.
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/publications/:path*'],
}
```

### Next-auth implementation

I am using Next-auth in my project, so I also include it here with their
[withAuth implementation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#advanced-usage).

```jsx:middelware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { withAuth } from 'next-auth/middleware'
import { gql } from 'graphql-request'

export default withAuth(async function middleware(req) {
  // function that verifies if the user is subscribed properly.
  // see below for information about the token
  const isSubscribed = async () => {
    const headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${req.nextauth.token.accessToken}`,
    }
    const userDetails = await fetch('https://yourDirectusApi/graphql', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        gql`
          query {
            customer_details(
                filter: { user: { id: { _eq: "$CURRENT_USER" } } }
            ) {
                subscribed
              }
            }
          }
        `,
      }),
    })

    if (userDetails.data.subscribed) return true
    return false
  }

  const url = req.nextUrl

  if (await isSubscribed()) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }

  // the user is not subscribed properly, we redirect her to the user panel
  // where she can subscribe.
  url.pathname = '/user/details'

  return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL(url, req.url))
})

// We only run the middleware for the dashboard part of the app for now.
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/publications/:path*'],
}
```

In this example, you can see that I call `req.nextauth.token.accessToken`. The reason is
in the configuration of my `[...nextauth].js` file. I will do a post specially on configuring
next-auth with directus.
