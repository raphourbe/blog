## Main context

I will show one way of implementing a newsletter subscription form using Directus as the backend.
I am sure that some other method exists though.

I assume that you have some understanding of a Flow, and how to modify Role & permissions, and add
fields to an existing Directus table. If not, please refer to
[Directus Documentation](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/introduction.html).

The subscription process for the user is quite simple: she enters her email, and receive an email
confirming the registration. In this email, there is a link to unsubscribe if needed, using a token.

This example can easily be complexified with an email validation process. I will explain how it could be
done after.

I am personnaly using Next.js to build my front, but any front would do, since you just need
to be able to do an API call.

## Configuring Directus

### Adding a new field to directus_users table

I have decided that every person subscribing to my newsletter would be a Directus user with a limited role.
This allows me to have tokens that can help me authenticate the user for the unsubscribe process, as we will see.

The `token` field already exist in the `directus_users` table.

For simplicity, I have added a `newsletter` field directly into the `directus_users` table.
It is a dropdown with two possible values: `active` or `unsubscribe`. The field is `active`
by default since I am not following the validation email pattern. If you wanted to follow
this pattern, see the _Final Thought_ part of this post.

### Adding a new role and giving it permissions

I created a new role named _"Prospect"_ for users, because I was launching a SaaS and
wanted to see if there were some prospects before the official release. And
of course, if there was, tell them when the SaaS was ready in a newsletter.

This **Prospect role** needs permissions to update only two fields: **newsletter** to
set it to unsubscribe if needed and its **token** field. We should also give it the
permission to read the newsletter field. When updating the _Field Permissions_, be sure to
add an _Item Permissions_ `ID Equals $CURRENT_USER` to avoid the user to manipulate other people's data.

### Modifying the Public role permissions

#### 1. Retrive the Role ID for the Prospect Role

Then, I changed the **Public role** authorization to allow anyone to create new users,
but only with a **Prospect role**. Indeed, a user on your website who is not
authenticated is just a Public user. So it is the **Public role** that
needs to be allowed to create new users. However, we do not want them to create
an Admin for example.

To do that, get the `Role ID` by going on the _users page_ in Directus and retrieve it in the URL.

![Get role id](/static/images/newsletter-subscription/get-role-id.webp)

#### 2. Update the Public role's Permissions to create Prospect users.

Next, you will go in the _Settings > Role & Permissions_ to allow **Public role**
to create _Directus Users_ with specific constraints: `email`, `status`, `role`,
`provider` and `token` for _Field Permissions_. These fields are required when
you want to use the API to create a new user (except `token` that we will use latter).

![Public User creating permissions](/static/images/newsletter-subscription/public-user-creating-permission.webp)

In the _Field Validation_ menu, add a filter: `Role is one of <Role ID>,`. I remember
trying to add `Role equals <Role ID>` but that did not work for some reasons.

#### 3. Update the Public role's Permissions to read Prospect users.

Finally, you want the **Public role** to be able to retrieved at least something
after making the request to create a user, in order to know everything worked
correctly. In the _Read_ property for _Directus Users_, allow the **Public role** to see
the `newsletter` field that we created for the User.

Basically, it means that if someone knows that you have a Directus backend,
and that you use the Directus Users system to register Newsletter in a field
named `newsletter`, she could make an API call and get... all the data in
`newsletter` field. So the maximum she can get would be the number of active
users for your newsletter, and the number of unsubscribed users.

So we bypass that awefull possibily by adding an _Item Permissions_ with:
`ID Equals $CURRENT_USER`. This way, the Public user will not be able to
get the number of subscriber to our newsletter :)

### Creating a Flow to send a confirmation email and an unsubscribe link

The Flow is really simple and should look like that:

![Sending email flow](/static/images/newsletter-subscription/sending-mail-flow.webp)

First, we put a trigger on the `items.create` of the `directus_users` table.
Then, we create a **Send Email** operation with the following requirements:

- `{{$trigger.payload.email}}` in the **To** field. Do not forget to press `Enter`. If you
  do not see a purple bloc appearing with your value under the **To** field, it will not work.
- Something like `https://your-front.com/unsubscribe?token={{$trigger.payload.token}}` inside
  your email's body.

The token refers to a generated token that Directus will create for us after an API
request we will make in the frontend part.

And this is it for the Directus part. Of course, be sure to properly configure the
[email sending](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/config-options.html#email).
This is not part of this tutorial. I shall do one soon. However, Directus uses
Node Mailer to send emails if that might help you.

## Preparing your front

### Creating the user

I let you handle the form part of your frontend. You just need to have one field that retrieve
one email.

My code for the mutation looks like this (I am using GraphQL and not REST here). First,
I call the `utils/random/string` endpoint to get a random token that I will assign to
the newly created user (yes, this can be done with another Flow though). Then, I do
a mutation to create the user with the brand new token.

```jsx
import { gql } from 'graphql-request'

const url = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API
const roleId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_PROSPECT_ROLE_ID

async function generate_random_token() {
  // This function generates a random token using an API
  // call to your Directus.
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }
  return await fetch(url + 'utils/random/string', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers,
  })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log('random token error:', error)
      return 'error'
    })
}

export const createUser = async (email) => {
  // First retrieve a token generated by Directus
  const get_token = await generate_random_token()
  const token = get_token.data
  if (token === 'error') return token

  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  }
  const query = gql`
    mutation {
      create_users_item(
        data: {
          email: "${email}"
          role: "${roleId}"
          status: "active"
          provider: "default"
          token: "${token}"
        }
      ) {
        newsletter
      }
    }
  `

  // Fetch data from external API
  return await fetch(url + 'graphql/system', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query,
    }),
  })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .catch((error) => {
      return 'error'
    })
}
```

Notice here that I have more fields than juste `email` and `token`. The other fields
are required to create users with an API call.

### Creating a page to unsubscribe

I have created a page on my front which is built using Next.js It looks like that:

```jsx
import { gql } from 'graphql-request'
import FrontFooter from '../components/front/footer'
import FrontNavBar from '../components/front/frontNavBar'

export default function Unsubscribe({ data }) {
  return (
    <div className="font-body">
      <FrontNavBar />
      <article className="container mx-auto">
        <h1 className="font-display text-bull mt-10 mb-6 pt-2 text-3xl md:text-6xl">
          You are now unsubscribed to our newsletter
        </h1>
      </article>
    </div>
  )
}

// This gets called on every request
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const token = context.query.tok
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  }

  // nullify the token in the mutation
  const query = gql`
    mutation {
      update_users_me(data: { newsletter: "suspended", token: ${null} }) {
        newsletter
      }
    }
  `

  // Fetch data from external API
  const res = await fetch(process.env.DIRECTUS_PUBLIC_API + 'graphql/system', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query,
    }),
  })
  const data = await res.json()

  if (data?.update_users_me?.newsletter === 'suspended') return { props: { data: true } }
  else return { props: { data: false } }
}
```

The `token: ${null}` in the mutation allows us to:

- avoid that the user try to unsubscribe more than one time.
- ensure us the user will not to make any API calls in the future.

No token = No API call. It's as simple as that :)

## Caveat with this method

Using the "new User method" to create newsletter's subscribers,
you have to be aware of one thing:
the `email` field in the `directus_users` table has the property `UNIQUE`.
Hence, if this allows you to ensure someone does not register multiple times,
you have to take care of this if you want people to register as users for
other part of your site.

For instance, if you create a **Customer role** in the future, be aware that
you will have to handle the switch between **Prospect** users and **Customer** ones.
If you forget, then the Customer creation for someone already in the Prospect list
will fail.

## Expanding with a validation process

This example can be complexified to add a validation process for the email entered.
For example, instead of sending an email with an unsubscribe link,
it could be a validation link based on the same principle.

Once the user clicks on this link and is directed to a page on your front, an API
call to switch the `newsletter` value from _not validated_ to _validated_ is done.
So you might create a newsletter field inside the `directus_users` table to be _not validated_ by
default, with two other values possible: _validated_ or _unsubscribed_.

You can also choose to create a new token for the user to be sure that the
validation link does not work anymore, and that the new token is used only to
unsubscribe.
