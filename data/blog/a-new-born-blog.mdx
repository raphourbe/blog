# Yet, another dev blog: but on what topic?

Mostly some tutorials to solve problems I had to
resolve myself because I did not find answers on the web, or they were hard to find. 
Maybe sharing my experience as a self-named CTO in a SME or some thoughts about technology?

# Yet, another dev blog: but why?

## Giving back

I am a huge user of Open Source solutions. Everything that I have built for PrimeView are
based on Open Source technologies: Next.js, Directus, Flask, Postgresql, plotly, etc.

I have also, as many developers out there, spent hours reading and watching free 'how to' guides.
Hence, it is time to thank all these people that have helped me one way or another, by giving back
to the community.

## Giving the solutions I did not find anywhere else

Often, when I was developing apps I encountered problems with no evident solution for a beginner. And often,
it appeared that when looking on Google to find a solution I ended up reading on severals websites the exact
same tutorial, scratching the surface of a subject and not even answering my questions.

When that occured, I was really pissed: why would people write a thousand times the same tutorial? For example,
I was looking at ways to make python's library pandas faster... Every single tutorial is like: "use vectorization"...
Why?! God WHY?! And all the time you have two examples: one with a for loop, and the other with the vectorization process,
using some meaningless "mean" function, and say: "Look! It's really faster."...

So my aim here is to give the solutions to some various problems I encountered, for which I did not find any solution
online. Maybe I did not search properly, or some have poped up since. But it will be my take.

# Yet, another dev blog: but how?

Since I am quite mad at people doing the same tutorial over and over, I will try to the best of my
abilities to avoid doing it myself.

Plus, I will try to avoid what I hate when reading tutorials. For example, when you read a tutorial on
some web development technique, half of it is about generating some "nice" html/css and installing thousands of
npm packages. Please, stop. We only need the details about how to implement the solution, not the whole website.
