# Integrate Stripe to Directus' flows

Integrating Stripe to a Directus' flow is quite simple. However, it is not obvious since 
it is not explained how to make use of nodejs modules inside flows.

The answer is in this [github discussion](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/15886#discussioncomment-3805119).

You just have to add : `FLOWS_EXEC_ALLOWED_MODULES=stripe,` in the `.env` file of directus.

Once you have done this, you can make use of the **Run Script** operation in Flow like that:

````js
module.exports = async function(data) {
  const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_something');
  
  // create a customer in Stripe
  const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
    email: data.read_user.email,
	name: data.read_user.firstName,
	metadata: {directusId: data.read_user.id}
  })
}
```

In this example, I use stripe to create a stripe's customer. After the flow is triggered, I have created an operation 
**"Read data"** that I have named `read_user`. Then you can access it in the next operation using `data.read_user`.

::: info

For information, when you use `data` in a run script for the function, it gives you all the payloads from the previous
operations of the actual flow.

Something like that:

```js
{
  '$trigger': {
    payload: {
	   variable: "something"
	},
    keys: [0],
  },
  "$last": {
    // informations of the last operation
  },
  read_user: {
    // the payload of the operation named "read_user"
  },
  ...
}
```

Notice that for the trigger, you have to access it with data["$trigger"].
