## Integrate Stripe to Directus' flows

Integrating Stripe to a Directus' flow is quite simple. However, it is not obvious since
it is not explained (yet?) how to make use of nodejs modules inside flows.

The answer is in this [github discussion](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/15886#discussioncomment-3805119).
Directus makes use of [vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2) which: "is a sandbox that can run untrusted code
with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. Securely!"

So, you just have to allow stripe to run in Flows by adding: `FLOWS_EXEC_ALLOWED_MODULES=stripe,`
in the `.env` file of directus.

Once you have done this, you can make use of the **Run Script** operation in Flow like that:

```js
module.exports = async function (data) {
  const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_something')

  // create a customer in Stripe
  const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
    email: data.read_user.email,
    name: data.read_user.firstName,
    metadata: { directusId: data.read_user.id },
  })
}
```

In this example, I use stripe to create a stripe's customer. After the flow is triggered, I have created an operation
**Read data** that I have named `read_user`. Then you can access it in the next operation using `data.read_user`.

## Tips

For information, when you use `data` as input for the function in a **Run script** operation, it gives you all
the payloads from the previous operations of the actual flow.

Something like that:

```js
{
  "$trigger": {
    payload: {
	   variable: "something"
	},
    keys: [0],
  },
  "$last": {
    // informations of the last operation
  },
  read_user: {
    // the payload of the operation named "read_user"
  },
  ...
}
```

Notice that for the `trigger`, you have to access it with data["$trigger"].
