## Context

See [Part 1](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part1) for Context details.

This series is structured as follows:

1. The design of the app, [part 1](https://rphl.dev/blog/building-saas-with-directus-and-stripe-part1)
2. The database [this post]
3. Directus flow
4. Stripe webhooks

Here we will focus on the database implementation.

## Four tables

In order to build my SaaS, I wanted to have different roles for the users, mainly `Admins` (me and my coworkers) and `Customers`.
We have only one single subscription, with a monthly price or an annual one, so I only needed one type of `Customers`.

Once I had created the `Customer` role in Directus, I needed to add a table to have more informations about them, like
details for the invoices (name, address, etc.) I found it easier for me to have a separate table instead of modifying the
`directus_users` table, even if it is doable.

Inspired by the database's model of [Ghost](https://ghost.io), I created:

- `customer_details` with some billing details for my Customers (name, address, etc.) to avoid
  modifying the `directus_users` table.
- `customer_subscriptions` with the details of the type of subscription Customers picked, the dates
  of trial's end, billing periods, etc.
- `subscription_items` with the informations regarding my subscriptions (price, stripe product ID, etc.)
- `stripe_tax` with informations regarding taxes I need to add to my Customers. Since I am in France,
  I needed to manage different VAT regarding the location of my Customers.

## The customer_details table

### Details

The main purpose of this table is to record users' billing addresses and their `Stripe Customer ID`.
My point here was to avoid modifying directly the `directus_users` table which is a system table.
It is possible to do so if you need to, but there might be an issue with a futur version of Directus
if it modifies this table. So, to be safe, I decided to create a new table for this role.

This table contains:

- id
- the same billind address informations required in Stipe, so I can send them to Stripe
  directly if needed or at least compare them.
- a boolean value telling if the Customer activated her account (`account_activated`)
- the `Stripe Customer ID`
- a `customer_subscriptions` One to Many relationship, where are stored the details for the subscription.
- a Many to One relationship to the `stripe_tax` table to get the `tax_id` linked to the billing address.
- a One to One relationship with the Customer in `directus_users`.

### Setting up the relationships

#### The One to One relationship

As mentioned in Directus' documentation on [relationships](https://docs.directus.io/configuration/data-model/relationships.html#many-to-one-m2o),
the One to One relationship is basically a Many to One relationship where you force the "One".

To set it in Directus, create the `Many to One` field and check the _Value has to be unique_ in the **Schema** part of
the new field.

You will notice when creating this kind of field that you can _Add Field to Related Collection_ in the **Relationship**
part. This will show you the field and let you manage the relationship from the linked table. For me, it would
allow me to see the `customer_details id` in the `directus_users` table for example. Please note that you
have this option for any kind of relationship.

#### The Many to One relationship, and the naming pitfall

You just have to follow the same steps than for a One to One relationship, without selecting the _Value has to be unique_ in the **Schema** part :).

One thing I have noticed though while using Directus, is that naming your field like `customer_subscriptions_id`
for a relationship between the `customer_details` table and the `customer_subscriptions` table is not
optimal. Even if the relationship is built on the `id` of the `customer_subscriptions` table.

Indeed, I used to create my database myself writing SQL, and for these relationships I used to
name the field like `<table>_id` to know the table and field I refered to. However, here, since you will probably
make API calls with it, it is disturbing to have a field with `id` in it.

For example, a graphQL query could be:

```jsx
query {
  query {
    customer_details(
      filter: { user_id: { id: { _eq: "$CURRENT_USER" } } }
    ) {
      account_activated
      user_id {
        role {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And as you can see, you have `user_id` which refers to your user... which is a little disturbing.
I made a mistake for this one. I think a better way would be to have `user` instead of `user_id`:

```jsx
query {
  customer_details(
    filter: { user: { id: { _eq: "$CURRENT_USER" } } }
  ) {
    account_activated
    user {
      role {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So you have to pay attention to your fields' names when using relationship.

## The subscription_items table

The table contains the informations of the Stripe products/subscriptions. I did not want to use Stripe API
to retrieve these informations all the time, so I decided to store them in database since they are not
supposed to change regularly.

Plus, I wanted my coworkers to be able to change the number of days of trial themselves without using Stripe dashboard
in case we wanted to do a special offer.

It contains:

- id
- The price of the product
- `stripe_price_id` which is the id Stripe requires when setting up the Checkout session.
- The product name
- The billing interval
- The number of days of trial.

## The customer_subscriptions table

This table could be merged with the `customer_details` table. I decided not to, in order to let me the
possibility of having several subscriptions type by user, latter in the futur. I also think that it is
easier to separate the purpose of each table: one for the customers' details, one for the subscriptions' details.
It contains:

- id
- The id of the `customer_details` (table described above)
- the id of the `subscription_items` (table described above)
- `stripe_subscription_status` which is the status of the payment sent by Stripe
  (see [Stripe doc](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-status)).
  Possible values are "incomplete", "incomplete_expired", "trialing", "active", "past_due", "canceled",
  or "unpaid". So I created a dropdown field in Directus. I look at this data when I went to decide if
  the Customer is allowed to access resources on my app.
- `trial_ends_at`, which represents when the trial will end, or if it has already ended and the customer
  needs to pay before having access.
- `ends_at`, which represent until when the Customer is allowed to access the resources if she is
  not in trial.

## The stripe_tax table

This table is really simple, it links the postal code to the `stripe_tax_id` given by Stripe when you
create different predefined Taxes in Stripe dashboard (or via API).

Hence, it contains:

- id
- `stripe_tax_id`
- a description to know which location is concerned
- a part of the postal code (in France, regarding the first 3 numbers of the postal code, you can know what
  kind of VAT to apply).
