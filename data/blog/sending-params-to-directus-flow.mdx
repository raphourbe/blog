## Context

Directus Flow are really useful and you can do a lot of things with them.
If at some point you need some external parameters though, you can get them using the
[Webhook Event to trigger a Flow](https://docs.directus.io/reference/system/flows.html#flow-with-get-webhook-trigger)
to retrieve them.

I used directus version `9.21` to test this solution.

This post is based on an answer I made on [github](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/16751).

## Process

If you call a Flow triggered by a GET Webhook with some parameters, 
you can use these parameters in your Flow. 

If I use in a **Run Script** operation with `console.log(data)` after my 
Event triggered by `http://localhost:8055/flows/trigger/9033763a-cd26-4eee-a309-0af14291622b?param1=hello&param2=world`,
it gives me:

## Ways to use them

### In a Directus Endpoint

The idea comes from [the github post](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/16751)).
You want to trigger a Flow from an external endpoint, and get the result, but you need to send some
specific parameters.

With a Directus endpoint it can be done with:

```jsx:endpoint.jsx
const axios = require("axios");

const result = (flow_uuid, params) => {
  try {
    const flow_response = await axios({
      url: "yourdirectus/flows/trigger/" + flow_uuid + "?param1=" + params[0],
      method: "GET",
    }).then((response) => {
      // whatever you want to do with response
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
```

### In another Flow

With this method, since you can make a request to a URL inside a Flow, 
you can use your _Webhook with some parameters Flow_. Maybe something like:

`http://localhost:8055/flows/trigger/flow_uuid?param1={{$trigger.something}}`
