## Context

In order to listen to Stripe webhooks, you need to verify that the current request
comes from Stripe by [checking the signature in the header](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures).
Then you can read the body of the request, do what you need to and send a proper response to Stripe.

However, to verify the signature using: `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(request.body, sig, endpointSecret);`
as mentioned in the documentation, you need to have request.body that is the raw request body. Otherwise
you will end up with this error:

> Webhook signature verification failed. No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload.
> Are you passing the raw request body you received from Stripe?
> https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node#webhook-signing

So you need to create two extension to properly read Stripe webhooks. One is a custom hook that
will retrieve the raw body for you. The second is a custom endpoint to listen to Stripe Webhook
and act accordingly. So your directus folder might look like:

```
.
├── extensions                          # All your extensions
    ├── endpoints                       # Listener for the Stripe webhooks
    |   └── stripe-webhook
    |       └── index.js
    └── hooks                           # Your custom hook using a middleware to retrieve the raw request body
        └── stripe-webhook-middleware
            └── index.js
```

## Create a custom hook

To create a custom hook, use the [tool to create a Directus extension](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/creating-extensions.html)
as mentioned in the documentation.

Then add this to create the hook. The solution comes
[from here](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/8633#discussioncomment-1844107)
and still works with Directus 9.18.

```js
// index.js
const express = require('express')

module.exports = function registerHook({ init }) {
  init('middlewares.before', async function ({ app }) {
    app.use(
      express.json({
        verify: (req, res, buf) => {
          // Change the path to your endpoint, for example: /stripe-webhook
          if (req.originalUrl.startsWith('/path/to/endpoint')) {
            req.rawBody = buf.toString()
          }
        },
      })
    )
  })
}
```

This will transform every request going to your endpoint `/path/to/endpoint` and add a rawBody
that Stripe will be able to use.

## Create a custom endpoint

Once you have your custom hook, you just have to adapt Stripe code example
to read req.rawBody and not req.body.

For example, following the [quickstart from Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/quickstart):

```js
export default (router, { services, exceptions }) => {
  const { ItemsService } = services
  const { ServiceUnavailableException } = exceptions

  const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_SOMETHINGSECRET')
  const endpointSecret = 'whsec_SOMETHINGSECRET'

  router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    // MAIN DIFFERENCE WITH STRIPE EXAMPLE
    let event = req.rawBody

    // Only verify the event if you have an endpoint secret defined.
    // Otherwise use the basic event deserialized with JSON.parse
    if (endpointSecret) {
      // Get the signature sent by Stripe
      const signature = req.headers['stripe-signature']
      try {
        event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
          req.rawBody, // MAIN DIFFERENCE WITH STRIPE EXAMPLE
          signature,
          endpointSecret
        )
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(`⚠️  Webhook signature verification failed.`, err.message)
        return res.sendStatus(400)
      }
    }

    // Handle the event
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'payment_intent.succeeded':
        const paymentIntent = event.data.object
        console.log(`PaymentIntent for ${paymentIntent.amount} was successful!`)
        // Then define and call a method to handle the successful payment intent.
        // handlePaymentIntentSucceeded(paymentIntent);
        break
      case 'payment_method.attached':
        const paymentMethod = event.data.object
        // Then define and call a method to handle the successful attachment of a PaymentMethod.
        // handlePaymentMethodAttached(paymentMethod);
        break
      default:
        // Unexpected event type
        console.log(`Unhandled event type ${event.type}.`)
        console.log(`The data object of the event: ${event.data.object}`)
    }

    // Return a 200 response to acknowledge receipt of the event
    res.sendStatus(200)
  })
}
```
