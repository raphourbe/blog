# The main problem

On version 9.18 of a self-hosted Directus, if your frontend is not on the same server as Directus,
you have to configure a few things to allow [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
requests.

If you only follow the actual Directus documentation, you might end up getting the "preflight"
request error like this.

However, even when properly configuring the parameters in the `.env` file of Directus,
I have noticed that I still had a problem on this level. Even when declaring to Directus
the address of my frontend as approved, I ended up having an error in production
because of the "preflight" request. [More information here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#functional_overview)
and on the [OPTIONS page](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS#requ%C3%AAte_de_pr%C3%A9-v%C3%A9rification_cross-origin_cors).

> Additionally, for HTTP request methods that can cause side-effects on server data
> (in particular, HTTP methods other than GET, or POST with certain MIME types),
> the specification mandates that browsers "preflight" the request, soliciting
> supported methods from the server with the HTTP OPTIONS request method, and then,
> upon "approval" from the server, sending the actual request.

So, if I understood properly, the problem was that Directus did not inform me with this request the websites that
are allowed to access the data.

However, even when adding the OPTIONS method in the Directus configuration the problem persisted.

In order to fix this issue, I configured Nginx to send for my Directus backend
the required parameters everytime a request was made.

# Configuration of Directus

In the `.env` file, you add the two main ingredients for our matter: the `OPTIONS` method
and the `X-PINGOTHER` allowed header.
For the other elements, I followed what is described in the
[Directus documentation](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/config-options.html#cors):

```
CORS_ENABLED=true
CORS_ORIGIN=true
CORS_METHODS=GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS
CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS=Content-Type,Authorization,X-PINGOTHER
CORS_EXPOSED_HEADERS=Content-Range
CORS_CREDENTIALS=true
```
