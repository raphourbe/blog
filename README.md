# Purpose of this blog

## Giving back
I am a huge user of Open Source solutions. Almost everything that I have built so far are based on Open Source technologies: Next.js, Directus, Flask, Postgresql, plotly, etc. 

I have also, as many developers out there, spent hours reading and watching free 'how to' guides. Hence, it is time to thank all these people that have helped me one way or another, by giving back to the community.

I'll mostly post some tutorials to solve problems I had to resolve myself because I did not find answers on the web, or they were hard to find. Maybe sharing my experience as a self-proclaimed CTO in a SME or some thoughts about technology?
